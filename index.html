			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Royal Life Saving Society Australia operates as Australia's leading aquatic safety educator and training provider, conducting courses in water competency, swimming, and personnel roles such as swim instructors and pool life guards. RLSSA operates as a not-for-profit organisation and is registered under the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commision (ACNC). <em>DesCo</em> have tasked me with designing and prototyping a website for Roayl Life Saving Society Australia.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Research was conducted in order to gain an understanding for the relationship between RLSSA, the people they directly work with, as well as the general Australian public. This was done so in order to uncover particular issues in which web design can be utilised as an intervention. Research consisted of mainly secondary research from official publications by Royal Lifesaving, divisioins of the Australian Federal Government, and news articles on relevant topics. An interview was also conducted, and was primarily used to help develop the "Parent" user profile.</p>
      <h4>Organisation's core aims</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>To reduce preventable drownings in Australia (this extends to a global outlook in which some donor funds are directed towards a "Global Drowning Fund"). This aim aligns with the goal set by the Australian Water Safety Council in 2008 for drowning to be reduced by 50% by 2020.</li>
          <li>Provide education and training to enable individuals to safely participate in aquatic based recreation activities.</li>
          <li>To train individuals to facilitate such activities (e.g. life guards)</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>General Audience</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Australian public as a general means to ensure minimal drownings throughout the nation, in alignment with the goal set by the Australian Water Safety Council in 2008.</li>
          <li>Parents - potentially looking to put their children into swimming lessons, or for home pool safety guidelines.</li>
          <li>Adults looking to develop water competency.</li>
          <li>Teenagers to adults seeking training for particular professional accreditation, e.g. first aid, lifeguard, learn-to-swim instructor</li>
          <li>Managers of facilities needing up to date information on regulations and standards</li>
          <li>Individuals wanting to donate to RLSSA's national and international causes or fundraise on their behalf</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Charity Work</h4>
        <p>As an organisation that is registered under the ACNC, Royal Life Saving Society Australia is a not-for-profit and accepts donations. These funds specifically go towards the organisation's "Swim and Survive Fund" and "Global Drowning Fund." The former aims to provide swimming and water safety courses to children from socially and/or economically disadvantaged backgrounds, as these groups tend to have limited exposure to aquatic settings. The latter aims to reduce the high occurrence of child drowning in Asia through skills programs, research and advocacy.</p>
      <h4>Focus Point: Drownings</h4>
        <p>RLSSA states that its goal is to make Australia a nation free of drownings(or <em>accidental drownings</em> as classified by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare), doing so through aquatic education and lifesaving skills.</p>
        <p><strong>Key ideas and statistics</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>In 2010-2012, accidental drownings was the 57th highest cause for premature death in Australia, however it was the 3rd highest cause for death for children aged 1-14. (AIHW, 2015)</li>
          <li>In 2019, the were 248 deaths as a result of drowning in Australian waterways, an 8% decrease in mortality from the previous year and a 12% decrease on the 10 year average. (Royal Life Saving Australia, 2020) This trend has been declining over the past few decades.</li>
          <li>Adults aged 25-34, 35-44, and 65-74 were the most represented groups in drowning deaths. (RLSSA, 2020)</li>
          <li>Deaths by drowning for children aged 0-4 significantly decreased by 52%. (RLSSA, 2020)</li>
          <li>80% of drownings were male. (RLSSA, 2020)</li>
          <li>The most common locations for this to occur in were rivers, oceans/harbours, and beaches, all outdoor locations. (RLSSA, 2020)</li>
          <li>25% of drownings came as a result of a recreational activity, the highest of any activity. (RLSSA, 2020)</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Focus Point: Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Communities and Individuals</h4>
        <p>Groups in Australia from culturally and linguistically diverse and non-english speaking backgrounds, are a community target group who Royal Life Saving tailor programs toward. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The 2016 Census found that people born overseas accounted for two thirds of Australia's population, with around 18% of this group arriving since 2012. (Ruskin, et al. 2018)</li>
          <li>Generally speaking, Australians born overseas display higher outcomes of health, with rates in areas such as mortality, hospitalisations, and lifestyle risk factors, being lower than that of the overall Australian population. (Ruskin, et al. 2018)</li>
          <li>Royal Life Saving's recent 10 year study on drowning deaths in Australia found that 30% of drownings were of those born overseas, an anomoly amidst the above trend. People born overseas are identified by Royal Life Saving as an <em>at risk group</em>.</li>
          <li>Local swimming and water safety programs for these groups are present within some communities that have high numbers of culturally diverse individuals. Some programs such as the NSW Arabic Youth Aquatic Recreation Program are operated in conjunction with Royal Life Saving while others aren't.</li>
          <li>Some community based programs are weak in regards to funding, particularly with increasing remoteness.</li>
          <li>In some circumstances, there is a correlation between individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds and low socio-economic status. This directly affects access to aquatic education and knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Other at Risk Groups to Consider</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Men aged 18-34</li>
          <li>People from low socio-economic backgrounds</li>
        </ul>
			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>User profiles were created in order to help define a clear idea for what the purpose of the website should be as well as particular design considerations to enhace the user experience for users. These profiles particularly refer to individuals from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.</p>
        <h4>The Parent</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Parent raising their family in Australian after settling (children can be either Australian or overseas born)</li>
            <li>35-55 years old</li>
            <li>Understands that it is a necessity for individuals in Australia to be competent in the water.</li>
            <li>Low to high-mid socio-economic background - (this will vary by individual depending on various factors such as living are, cultural background, etc. This can be a determinant in whether a parent decides if swimming lessons are viable or not)</li>
            <li>Feels a sense of responsibility for their children - might also like to take part in lessons</li>
            <li>Unsure of how to go about visiting places around water bodies e.g. lakes, beaches, etc. and hence stays away.</li>
            <li><strong>Goals</strong> - to find an appropriate program for their child(ren) to develop proficency in aquatic environments, one in which they are learning alongside if possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Motivations</strong> - the safety and development of their child(ren) growing up in Australia</li>
            <li><strong>Frustrations</strong> - lack of understanding of what suitable programs are readily available to them, diffculty in finding one (the RLSSA website is very dense with content and can't quite help with offering direct solutions)</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>"(In an emergency) I can't help them, so this is a life-saving skill" - Sree Avirneni (ABC News, 2019)</blockquote>
        <h4>The International</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Individuals who recently arrived in Australia for reasons such as study, holiday, business, migration, etc.</li>
            <li>Age ranges from university student age to middle age.</li>
            <li>Would sign up for a swim program for adults if the opportunity arose, however they are unsure whether their community offers any such programs and doesn't know where to look.</li>
            <li>Limited in knowledge of types of water bodies and their characteristics. This however is dependant on each individual's upbringing as some may be familiar with particular water bodies from their country of origin.</li>
            <li>Understanding and ability to use the English language varies.</li>
            <li><strong>Goals</strong> - to be more literate in the characteristics of various aquatic environments in Australia, to develop proficiency in aquatic skills</li>
            <li><strong>Motivations</strong> - to integrate well into Australian culture, to be able to enjoy outings and activities with others around aquatic environments</li>
            <li><strong>Frustrations</strong> - unsure of where to find appropriate information and courses, courses in particular are frustrating as most seem to be directed towards children instead of adults</li>
          </ul>

      <h3 id="concept">Concept Proposal</h3>
        <p>The proposed solution is a website that will provide essential information for various aquatic environments and activities in Australia, alongside a search tool to help users find appropriate aquatic education programs. The aim for this is to ensure that this content is easily accessible by those who  find it difficult to navigate through the RLSSA homepage or to any other sources for such information, providing a one-stop destination for this. The content is easily navigable and understood, aiming to bring accessibility to the target audience of overseas born individuals and those of diverse cultural backgrounds, who together represent a significant fraction of deaths by drowning in Australian waters. In a holistic view, this website aims to reduce deaths by drowning by making essential information more accessible to those who need it.</p>

		<section id="ideation">
			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>The ideation process saw me develop a structure for my website through iterating my sitemap. This was followed by an exploration of web design precedents with key inspirations forming a moodboard. The content on my moodboard will go on to inform some of my design based decisions. Several sketches were drawn, proposing my ideas in a more visual manner. Both desktop and mobile platforms were considered from this section onwards as consideration for responsive design to cater for users on various devices.</p>
      <h3 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h3>
        <p>My <strong>first</strong> iteration sees a home landing page leading into three other sections of the website, these being a learning section, a dedicated section for drowning, and a section on finding appropriate programs.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="maps/map1.jpg" alt="Sitemap 1"/>
          <figcaption>Sitemap iteration 1</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>My <strong>second</strong> iteration rearranged the the sections into a more logical layout. Since the section on drowning felt like an “About” page, it felt appropriate to make it the first section. An additional “donate” section was also added in the event that a user wanted to learn more about Royal Life Saving’s work and to further support them. This felt appropriate as the funds that are run by RLSSA directly feed into programs that support at risk groups such as individuals of culturally diverse backgrounds. This mapping section in general also elaborates on my ideas and intentions.</p>

        <p>My <strong>third</strong> sitemap iteration condenses my previous iteration into a clearer layout, this time also with consideration for learning content.</p>

			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>I created a moodboard of particular web design precedents that I particularly liked and felt could be implemented into my own design.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="moodboard.jpg" alt="moodboard"/>
        <figcaption>Design precedents to gain inspiration from</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>I particularly like Tess Pyke's <strong>NZBlood</strong> Campaign due to its use of high contrast vector graphics. Here it was used as splash imagery as well as to section parts of her web content.</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic of Tomorrow</strong> by Walid Beno showcases a use of tiles in conjunction with events leading into animations.</li>
        <li><strong>Soccerbible</strong> is a website that I frequently use, in both desktop and mobile form factors. Its use of a side panel menu is something I feel that I can use to section my content. I also liked how the hamburger icon animates into a cross icon when entering into the side bar. Another thing to note is how the rest of the page dims in order to cast focus onto the menu.</li>
        <li>There are certain key elements from the official <strong>Royal Life Saving Society</strong>'s website that I felt should be implemented into my own design if I were to logically make it an extension of the original (my intention is not to redesign this). Things I took note of included the shades of blue in its colour palette, the use of the organisation logo, and the use of a rounded typeface. Implementing these into my design would create a degree of homogeneity between my own design and the "core" website.</li>
      </ul>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>When a user first enters my website, they are met with the landing page (Landing Sketch 1). This page features a splash graphic underneath a large font title text. The title is meant to allude to learning in a safe and controlled aquatic environment such as the shallow end of a swimming pool. In the top corners of the page are the menu button, as denoted by the hamburger icon, and a button that allows users to change the text language.</p>
      <p>Scrolling down, users are met with a brief "about" section. I relocated this to the home/landing page of the website as I felt that due to its brief nature, it didn't warrant having its own section. This also makes the navigation experience a lot more managable for users.</p>
      <p>Scrolling further down, users are met with either the option to progress towards other sections of the website. This should guide users better if they are unaware of the menubar on the left, or to prompt users if they've come onto the website without a clear intention.</p>

        </figure>
      <p>The learn page consists of two lines of cards, one for the various kinds of aquatic environments which individuals might participate in recreation at, and the other for the activities individuals may take part in within aquatic environments. A brief introduction paragraph to this section of the website is present at the top of the page. The menu and language change buttons remain present in the section as well as all other sections.</p>
      <p>Each card features a graphic, title, and brief description. Each row will feature three cards at a time, though users are able to cycle through the cards by clicking the arrows on either side of the row. On mobile platforms such as tablets and phones, users will only be able to see two or one card at a time respectively. On mobile platforms however, users will be able to scroll sideways to cycle through the cards instead of tapping an arrow.</p>

      <p>When a user hovers their mouse over a card, the card will stand out. If the user then clicks on it, they will be taken to the card’s content. Each card contains about three key areas of content which are sectioned off as shown below. I tried two variations of presentation for the expanded cards, one where the user is transported to a new page on the website, and the other that sees the card pop up on top of all the other content on the page. I proceeded with the latter variation in my next iterations as I felt that this would make navigation a lot easier (users don’t need to try to navigate back to a core “learn” page.)</p>

      <p>The program search section of the website features an introduction to aquatic safety and skills programs, as well as some examples for what particular programs are available. Users are able to fill in a digital form in order to find an appropriate program for them. An interactive map will display results for them, with tiles on the side and the map dominating the right.</p>
      <p>Once the user clicks on one of the programs shown, the card expands over all other options and displays more information of the venue and program. The map portion will also zoom into the particular venue, displaying a button that will take users to Google maps.</p>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>The design process saw me create both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for my proposed website. These were stemmed from the above sketch prototypes, whereby I created wireframes followed by final mockups.</p>
      <h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <p>The buttons at the bottom of the landing page are now a lot smaller than seen in my sketch iteration. The mobile version of the landing page sees the “Drowning is preventable” section altered in order to match the change from a horizontal screen to vertical screen. This is also translated by the bottom buttons in which they are stacked as opposed to being side by side.</p>
      <figure>

          <figcaption>Mobile Landing Wireframe</figcaption>
        </figure>
      <p>The learn remains unchanged from the sketch iteration aside from the addition of the activities row now being visualised. The mobile version is also quite similar, albeit the section text is centralised as opposed to being biased towards the left side of the screen. The mobile version also excludes buttons that allow users to navigate through the different tiles. Mobile users are hinted to swipe through these cards by the cards hanging off of the edges of the screen.</p>

      <p>The contents of each “learn” card are organised as shown below. Desktop users will have their topics laid out in rows, whereas mobile users will see this all stacked. Mobile users also won’t see the cards pop out from the screen, rather seeing them in an entirely different page. This is so that content isn’t compressed for mobile users.</p>

      <p>The program finder page now presents the user with suggested programs before venues. These programs are also given a description. I felt that it wasn’t very realistic to be able to showcase all or many programs to the user if I was to keep it condense and so created this particular section. These program suggestions will stack on top of each other for mobile users as opposed to being side by side. Mobile users also will not be presented with a map, instead being restricted to seeing program and venue previews.</p>

      <p>The menu bar pops out from the left side of the screen for both desktop and mobile users. The presentation is the same across both, with section headings listed on the side, social media links on the bottom, and a close icon just out of the top right corner. Depending on which section of the website a user is on, the relevant page will be in larger font, indented, and underlined.</p>

      <p>The landing page features a colour palette that is derived from RLSSA’s website, creating the graphic that users first see. While the yellow isn’t directly derived from RLSSA’s branding, I felt that it was appropriate due to its connotations to life guards and sand(which it was representing). RLSSA’s logo also features at the top right corner, acting as a link to their main website if clicked on by the user. The page heading is no longer sloped as I found that a flat look felt more presentable. Both the desktop and mobile versions feature an arrow at the bottom of the initial screen as a means to tell users to scroll down (or click on the arrow) as the graphic doesn't provide that same affordance.</p>

      <p>The colour palette is consistent across all elements within the website. For the “Learn” and “Find a Program” sections of the website, the top bar has been made blue in order to give it more presence. Seeing these pages without that top bar made it feel very empty and unstructured. Stock images were used for the content tiles, however I do intend to create my own vector graphics when prototyping to match the aesthetic of the landing page. The amount of content that is displayed on the tiles is kept brief.</p>

      <p>When the user enters one of the content cards, the graphic is resized to form a banner. The mobile version of these cards will allow users to go back to the main “Learn” page via the arrow underneath the banner, or to select a different category by the buttons at the bottom of the page.</p>

      <p>Users fill in a form in order be provided with suggestions for what programs and venues to attend. The form shown provides example questions, with some being required as indicated by the red asterisk. The mobile version doesn’t feature a box that encloses the form so that the page doesn’t feel too constrained. The ability to open Google Maps is now present as well.</p>
